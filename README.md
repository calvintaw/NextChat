# NextChat

A full-stack Discord & Telegram inspired chat app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), [postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

⚠️ **Note:** The README is outdated. A lot of the UI and functionalities have changed. New features have come out. Currently working on updating the doc.

The first half of the commits are in this [Repository](https://github.com/calvintaw/NextChat-Outdated).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A Supabase project with API keys

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calvintaw/discord_clone.git
cd discord_clone
npm install
```

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and fill it out like this:

```env

# Node.js socket server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=

# Vercel environment variables
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL= # URL of your deployed site

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Flaws

- No email verification
- No login rate limiting
- User IDs are visible in URLs (potential security issue)
- there is no Password reset or update feature.
- Code is messy in some files
- Probably more that I haven’t noticed yet
- supabase database has basically no rules. - all access for ANON.

Comments like `// generated by chatgpt` exist in some files.
That just means I didn’t write that part, I had ChatGPT generate it for me either because I couldn’t figure it out at the time or I was being lazy

## My Genuine thoughts

I worked on this project for about 4-5 months (initial commit on May, 2025). maybe less or more. I didn't work on it everyday though.

Now that it’s done, I have mixed feelings. I kinda hate it bc it took me so long and I feel dumber but at the same time, I love it.

I used ChatGPT for maybe around 2-3% of the project, mostly for making it correct my syntax errors or asking for ideas. Later on, I started using it more when I got stuck, especially with writing UI components, useEffects and even debugging errors. At some point, I realized I was relying on it too much. And that’s not where I want to be. So in total, probably around 8-10% is by AI. I feel myself that I am using less and less of my own thinking and it is making me feel unesay and also stupider. I can probably say like I am a shit coder.

The good things with this project, though, is my Next.js skills definitely improved, but my React fundamentals, or rather my logical thinking, still need work. I even failed to build a simple Snake game from scratch, ended up using code from a blog and patched it with ChatGPT’s help to make it work. I’m not exactly proud of that, but it is what it is.

This project has turned into a place where I experiment with everything I’ve found interesting or wanted to try and learn such as adding a audio feature or a video chat feature. That is why my commits are so random. BUT now, I am moving on.

I gonna try to learn react native and do some projects because I think it is cool to build mobile apps
Plus, I plan to learn everything I missed in here and use this project as a reference in the future.
